With today‚Äôs social media algorithm, you can tell when you‚Äôre obsessed over a certain idea or topic when majority of your feed is about that. That was me 2 months ago with progressive workouts. Not that I‚Äôm no longer obsessed, it‚Äôs just that I am trying to slowly reduce my use of social media. I started with removing my main Instagram account from my phone, but right now, I will actually remove the entire app. And if I would require access to my account, I can do it on web. That would be a hassle and hence, done less often.

Progressive workouts were not always my thing just 1 year ago but having completed my back to running program gave me a really different mindset of things. This all started early last year when I fell and broke me ACL while skiing. Given that I was kind of sporty in my teenage days, I never really paid so much attention to health and fitness, or the lack of. In fact, I can‚Äôt even remember if I did any real exercise 6 months before the incident. I just assumed that I was still sporty and all and could ski from medium difficulty level confidently. I guess it was a complacency of my fitness level and how well my previous skiing experience went, and this time, it did not go so well. I had to go through a surgery and 2 weeks of recovery before I could start walking again.

Fast forward to physiotherapy sessions, I learnt that my body was in fact slightly unbalanced before the incident. My right leg is evidently much stronger than my left leg, given that I could do somewhat a full pistol squat on the right leg while I could barely reach halfway with my left leg. This meant that there was a higher chance of injury since the left could not withstand the same pressure as the right. So thereafter, the aim was then to get my left leg stronger to reduce the imbalance. 

Although I could see my left leg getting stronger bit by bit, my motivation was low. Walking was still painful, let alone down the stairs. I had a back to running program which I started and was inconsistent. With the lack of trainings due to festive periods, my stamina was bad and my left leg hurt with every step I took. I wanted to recover quickly. I wanted to do more. I wanted to run and jump and all the things I could do before. But this was the reality, and it weight me down more often than I wished.

It was not until the start of 2025 that I gave myself a good excuse to write down goals in hopes that this year I will fulfil them. Knowing myself and from past years‚Äô resolutions, I did not have high expectations. Nevertheless, I gave myself the goal of completing the back to running program. It definitely was not easy initially. My stamina was still bad and my leg was still painful but each run was short enough that I could bare the pain. In addition, I learnt shortly after that if my legs were already warmed up with half an hour of exercises, the pain would be much less. On top of this, my gym sessions included strengthening of the thighs and calves which definitely helped in running.

Before I knew it, I completed the running program and I was thrilled! On hindsight, I realised that the reason why I managed to complete this new year‚Äôs resolution was because of a few things. Firstly, it was something I really wanted to do. And since I set my mind to do it, I did it with gritted teeth. I guess it really depends on how badly I wanted to get it done. Secondly, I had the physical sheet of running program lying on my table. After every session, I would check it off and record my time and distance. This gave me immense satisfaction that with just the fact that I was checking off each session and visually see that I was nearing the completion. The slight improvements in timing or distance also motivated me further. Thirdly, I realised this only later that it was because this goal is progressive. Not the usual ‚ÄúRun 5km‚Äù goal that I would usually write down in my diary and look back half a year later to not have even done a single 1km run. This goal started with baby steps, with the simplest step that I knew (or the creators knew) that I can complete. With each session conquered, the next would be just slightly more difficult, pushing me forward.

I guess, I was hooked. I started exploring and researching on progressive workouts, watching content creators explain and share their experiences and slowly drew up various plans to reach my goals. The progressions were undoubtably not always smooth and increasing. Some days require more motivation and perseverance than others and sometimes my improvements were not as fast as I had hoped for, but I could still see the improvements. These progressive workouts made me believe that I could achieve my goals and somehow gave me confidence even beyond the fitness world. It definitely gave me an entire mindset change and I really love it! I believe that similarly, with other areas in my life, I can reach my goal with putting in a little bit of effort every day, definitely not the all-or-nothing idea that I have believed for the last 20+ years of my life.

Anyway, my back to running program below provided by my then-physiotherapist. Very slow running but I guess I‚Äôll work on that progressively. üôÇ

To summarise why I think my progressive workouts are successful:

1. It is something that I really wanted to do or achieve.
2. I review it often and savour the improvements.
3. Small achievable next steps.
