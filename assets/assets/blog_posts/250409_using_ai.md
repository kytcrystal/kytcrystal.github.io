# Interesting Way of using AI as a Budding Developer

As a non-proficient UI developer, I have taken to ChatGPT to generate initial code snippets to understand what kind of blog layout I would like. I am currently learning Flutter and hence have set-up my project based in Flutter.

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/learn) according to Gemini, is a UI toolkit, developed by Google, used for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, leveraging the Dart programming language. Basically, it is a framework that can be used to build applications seamlessly on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux.

As a first-time frontend developer, and also a first-time blogger, I am definitely super excited to get started with going about and doing things, without knowing what I am actually doing. I would like to, at this point, add a disclaimer that I at least I have covered the basic lectures of building my first Flutter app.

Anyway, the first thing I want to do, is to visualise what kind of blog I would like to create. And I found that using our AI friendly assistant to help in this is an effective way to get motivated and get started. With a few simple prompts, this is my first version.

I wanted to have the various sections to write about so I thought these sections could be shown in the home page. But I think this is not really the vibes I was going for. Let’s try again, maybe a minimalist style. And perhaps for now I can just list the diary entries by title? Also, throw in some navigation.

Not too shabby… I guess I could work with this for now. At least it is minimally usable and I will improve on this design as I explore more about Flutter.

Having said that AI is a good way to generate starting code to visualise and set the directions, I must admit that there are multiple things that could potentially be a road block for someone unfamiliar with writing code.

1. Outdated code: The code generated by ChatGPT is probably not the most updated one. In fact, it might even be based on the syntax that was from the versions before, and some functions might have already been deprecated or had its name changed. This would cause error when running the code.
2. Wrong suggestions: Sometimes, ChatGPT may provide really useful suggestions but sometimes it might just not be the ones that we need. In many cases, it is difficult to tell. So in these situations, the traditional method of Googling and finding answers from Stack Overflow might just be better.

Also, notably that the code generated by ChatGPT might not be the best one. Because there are some code smells. Admittedly, the code that I write is definitely not great, but there are still some anti-patterns that are quite obvious. Basically, if it is not prompted to generate code with good standard, it will probably not.

For context, ChatGPT suggested that I keep my blog posts in a List, which is definitely not what I want in the future for maintainability and scalability sake. The simple method that I would choose for my blog now, is to just store each post in a separate markdown file, until I learn a better way to do it. But for the sake of just visualising the layout, I guess the generated suggestion below is forgivable.

``` Dart
final List<Map<String, String>> blogPosts = [
    {'title': 'My First Blog Post', 'content': 'This is the content of my first blog post.'},
    {'title': 'Exploring Flutter', 'content': 'Flutter is an amazing framework for building apps!'},
    {'title': 'My Fitness Journey', 'content': 'Here’s how I started my fitness journey.'},
  ];
