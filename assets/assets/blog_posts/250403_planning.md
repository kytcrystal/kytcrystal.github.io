# Importance of Planning

I find that when I have a full day without any appointments or anything planned, I tend to feel more anxiety. You might think, why? I have pondered over this a little and came to the conclusion that it is probably because I would have so many things that I wanted to do but don’t know where to start or which to start with. It is almost like when you go for a buffet session where there are so many delicious food in front of you and you can’t wait to try everything all at once! Choosing one of the food might do a disservice to another. Yeah, that’s exactly how I feel, just that instead of the food in front of my eyes, it is more the thought of these activities swimming around in my mind.

I have so many exciting things in my mind that I would like to work on but I can’t put my finger on which to go first because I have also to balance the utility of each activity, the time I can afford to spend on the activity, the deadline (both hard and soft deadline) and how excited am I to actually do the activity. So with my mind a muddled mess, I tend to escape reality into what we call doom scrolling until I get even more stressed than before, that I have wasted half the day not doing anything. And then it would be a downward spiral where I start sulking, feeling bad about myself for not using my time wisely.

That’s why I have decided to write my thoughts down and also do some planning that will help ease my mind. This is my first diary entry and I guess am I one of those people who start journalling when they feel a sudden need for change in their life.

Anyway, back to my planning. In these 2 years, my partner and I have actually came across many interesting ideas about organising life and being a more productive person. It is really a pity that we always say to each other “oh yeah, this is a good piece of advice” but without noting it down. Then 2 days later, we would forget that piece of great advice. Nevertheless, I still have a couple of these ideas etched in my mind.

## Time Management Lecture

The most significant for me is [**Randy Pausch Lecture: Time Management**](https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0?si=BH05ZJFzLsfX6hy3). It is one of the best lectures I have heard - inspirational, insightful, thought provoking, emotional and even humourous.

Side tracking a little, the lecture on time management was so good, we ventured to his other (probably more popular) lecture video [**Randy Pausch Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo). There’s also a digitally remastered version of [**Randy Pausch's Last Lecture - Remastered**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayPMfopCe1g)** for a much higher definition video quality since the original video was from 2007.

Back to the time management lecture. There are so many bite size useful lessons in this lecture but for the purpose of this diary entry, I want to focus on just couple of ideas, which I believe are already out there and popularised even earlier before but Randy puts it in an interesting way.

## Planning

As we all know, things don’t always go as planned, but it doesn’t go as planned only because there is a plan! Hence, “You can always change your plan, but only once you have one!” The plan is a basis that we can start with to progressively evolve and improve on. Failing to plan is indeed planning to fail. That is definitely the first step that I should do.

This year, I feel that I have definitely been more in control of my life, with setting my 2025 goals as well as quarterly and monthly goals on fitness and my romantic relationship. I still struggle greatly on how to set goals on other things. Similar to periodic goal setting, planning can also be done for the year, quarter, month, week and day, starting of course from the year. Planning on a higher scale would involve knowing what I want to achieve for the year and somehow, it is a form of goal setting. So I guess I can no longer escape from setting my goals.

Planning also involves writing the to-do list and here Randy emphasized on breaking the to-do items into small and manageable steps. And doing the ugliest first. Of course, speaking about the to-dos, we cannot miss out on Stephen Covey’s Four-Quadrant To-do, which was mentioned in Randy’s lecture. Obviously, we should first do the important item that is due soon and give the least priority to the not important and not due soon item. The next in line, is actually the important and not due soon item. Because, in the end, we will find that the not important but due soon item, is in fact, not important to actually do! So by not doing it, we get the time that we thought we didn’t have enough! That why, we need to prioritise our items in the to-do list and do the things that are important to us.

Ok, enough said (or write). It’s time to get to work, not before this quick summary:

1. Plan my time in terms of year, quarter, month, week and day
2. Write my to-dos (small and manageable)
3. Prioritise my to-dos
